# Rust and Python

This repository contains various (sometimes random) functionalities implemented in both Rust and
Python that I personally use for performance comparisons.

I mainly created this repository to try out Rust and how to use the implemented Rust functionalities in Python.
Rust can provide a significant performance boost, especially in terms of speed, which makes it an interesting
approach when looking into optimizing Python-based projects.


## How To

### Build Rust Modules

To build the Rust modules for Python to use, run the command from the repository root:

```bash
make setup
```

### Run Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
make test
```
