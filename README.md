# Rust and Python

This repository contains various (sometimes random) functionalities implemented in both Rust and
Python that I personally use for performance comparisons.

I mainly created this repository to try out Rust and to learn how to use the implemented Rust modules in Python.
Rust can provide a significant performance boost, especially in terms of speed, which makes it an interesting
approach when looking into optimizing Python-based projects.
