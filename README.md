# Rust and Python

This repository contains various (sometimes random) functionalities implemented in both Rust and
Python that I personally use for performance comparisons.

I mainly created this repository to try out Rust and to learn how to use the implemented Rust modules in Python.
Rust can provide a significant performance boost, especially in terms of speed, which makes it fairly interesting
to explore when looking into optimizing Python-based projects.

I will add examples to this repository as I delve more and more into the world of Rust... and also when time permits.

## How To

### Build Rust Modules

To build the Rust modules for Python to use, run the following command from the repository root:

```bash
make setup
```

### Run Tests

Run all the tests from the repository root with the command:

```bash
make test
```
